        <dl>
            <dt>Version 0.1.1</dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uses my own motion physics to move the vehicle, its spatial coordinates are changed directly.</li>
                    <li>Can't use framework collision system and separation because the vehicle is not moved by phaser</li>
                    <li>I wrote a similar collision and separation system. Less precise, but this way lap time is independent from computer performance.</li>
                    <li>Movement is calculated considering a constant acceleration motion in small dt intervals. Acceleration depends on velocity, decreasing to 0 for v = vmax. Linear and angular frictions are implemented. Linear friction is proportional to velocity, angular friction is constant. Angular motion is uniform, constant angular velocity, a=0.</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>Version 0.1.0</dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uses my own physics to set the phaser physics velocity.</li>
                    <li>Vehicles are moved changing their velocity, the velocity is calculated using polar coordinates in the plane space.</li>
                    <li>Lap time depends on computer performance since velocity is increased at fps intervals.</li>
